Disclaimer
This project was developed strictly for educational purposes and as a demonstration of how malicious software operates. It is intended to help cybersecurity professionals understand and mitigate potential threats. The use of this software for malicious or unauthorized purposes is illegal and unethical. Always obtain explicit permission before deploying or testing any software of this nature.</br>


<h2>This advanced keylogger includes the following functionalities:</h2>

**Keystroke Logging:** Tracks and logs all keyboard inputs.

**Screenshot Capture:** Takes screenshots of the system every second.

**System Information Retrieval:** Collects detailed system information (e.g., OS version, hardware specs).

**Clipboard Monitoring:** Captures and logs clipboard contents.

**Data Transmission:** Sends all logged data to a specified email account.

**Cat Game Overlay:** Includes a fun, Chrome Dinosaur-like cat game to distract the user while the keylogger operates in the background.</br>


<h2>How It Works</h2>

The program runs in the background, tracking keystrokes and taking screenshots.

It periodically retrieves system and clipboard information.

All captured data is encrypted and sent to a predefined email address.

The cat game serves as a decoy, running in the foreground to engage the user.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

Python 3.7 or higher

Required Python libraries:

pynput (for keystroke logging)

pyautogui (for screenshots)

platform (for system information)

smtplib (for email sending)

pygame (for the cat game overlay)
